# Honolulu, Hawaii Climate Analysis
Using a provided SQLite database for Hawaii weather including temperature and precipitation from stations across the state from Jan 1, 2010 to Aug 23, 2017 to create a locally hosted webpage app to pull data based on given inputs.

# Features
* Explore the data to determine what features to host (climate.ipynb)
     * Use SQLAlchemy to connect to the SQLite database
     * Review precipitation for the last 12 months using a pandas dataframe
          * Create a plot of the precipitation using pandas 
          * Print summary statistics
     * Find the most active station and 
          * calculate the lowest, highest, and average temperatures
          * create a histogram of the temperature readings
* Create the locally hosted app with the following extensions
     1. /
          * homepage listing all the available routes.
     2. /api/v1.0/precipitation
          * Return the JSON representation of station precipitation readings by date for the last 12 months.
     3. /api/v1.0/stations
          * Return a JSON list of stations from the dataset.
     4. /api/v1.0/tobs
          * Return a JSON list of temperature observations of the most active station for the previous year.
     5. /api/v1.0/<start> and /api/v1.0/<start>/<end>
          * Return a JSON list of the minimum temperature, the average temperature, and the maximum temperature for a specified start or start-end range.
          * For a specified start, calculate TMIN, TAVG, and TMAX for all the dates greater than or equal to the start date.
          * For a specified start date and end date, calculate TMIN, TAVG, and TMAX for the dates from the start date to the end date, inclusive.
